# obsidian-file-info-panel-plugin

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) creates a File Information view that displays the active file's date created, date modified, file size, and links to open the file in its native application and to open the file's folder.  It also has writing statistics (character, word, sentence, and paragraph counts) and a word frequency analysis.

## Usage

After enabling the plugin in the settings menu, you should see the info button appear in the left navigation panel.  This will toggle the File Info Panel view.

The File Info Panel settings allows you to set which file information is displayed.

## Features

- Click on the file name to open the file in its native app.
- Click on the folder name to open the file's location.
- Unobtrusive text matches your currently installed theme.
- File size is displayed in human-readable format (includes bytes, KB, MB, GB, etc.).
- Image files show image width and height.
- Dates include human-readable "from now" text.  Example:

> Mon, Nov 22, 2021 7:59 PM
> 
> 21 days ago

- Writing statistics:
	- Character, word, sentence, and paragraph counts.
	- Selected text's character, word, sentence, and paragraph counts.
	- Estimated page count based on your provided words per page.
	- Word frequency analysis.  Optional split into two lists based on your provided regex.
	- URLs and File names can be separate from Word counts.

## Say Thanks üôè

Consider reading and sharing one of my books (available through Amazon).  There are fantasy, science fiction, novelty art books, non-fiction, and a thriller.  Share links to them.  Seriously, I really need your help as an author getting the word out. Trying to be an independently-published author is challenging.

You'll also find a bunch of free content and writing/art tools on my personal website.
